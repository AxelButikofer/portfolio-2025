      created this experimental project during my second year of training. My
      goal was to focus more on visual and aesthetic aspects. The idea is to
      evoke emotions through a series of still shots with a strong atmosphere.
      There is no synopsis, as I chose to work in a metaphorical way, aiming to
      immerse the viewer in a universe without offering explicit explanations."
