            Hi, I’m Axel Bütikofer and im 22 years old, currently studying to
            become an Interactive Media Designer at a school of applied arts
            called eikon. Throughout my training, I have acquired a wide range
            of skills that allow me to adapt to various situations. However, my
            true passion lies in graphic design, video, and more recently,
            motion design.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside of the professional realm, I greatly enjoy video games of
            all kinds, music, and the cultural scene, which help me recharge and
            inspire my creative work.
          </p>
